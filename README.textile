To restore a instance, follow instructions here

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/creating-an-image.html#registering-the-ami

Run these commands locally

Connect to S3 through S3Hub and change primary_server_backup/mondy* to be readable by everyone 
	This is optional if I can get the ec2-register command to connect to it with my private key and certificate.
	See http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/message.jspa?messageID=126461 
	Grant za-team@amazon.com read access to primary_server_backup and all its files should be good enough!!

$ ec2-register primary_server_backup/monday.manifest.xml
IMAGE ami-xxxxxxxx

$ ec2-run-instances -k ec2-keypair ami-xxxxxxxx

$ ec2-deregister ami-xxxxxxxx

$ ec2-describe-instances

Assocaite the elastic IP to this new instance when the new instance is verified thoroughly

$ ec2-associate-address IP -i INSTANCE

Terminate the old instance

$ ec2-terminate-instances OLD_INSTANCE

IDEA

Create a post in bbs
Cron runs a script every 10 minutes to check content of that post to decide what to do
E.g.: forward a game from TOM, forward a game from another URL
Keep a history to avoid duplicate posts
